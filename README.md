# Engineering Solver

A desktop application designed for mechanical engineering calculations in the building services construction industry. The initial focus is a user-friendly duct sizing solver that calculates key parameters like area and velocity, built from scratch using Python and Tkinter. This tool aims to streamline workflows by replacing cumbersome Excel-based methods with an intuitive interface and robust error handling.

## Features

* **Duct Sizing Solver**: Calculate cross-sectional area and airflow velocity for rectangular and round ducts.
* **Interactive UI**: Input fields for duct dimensions and flow rate, with a dropdown for duct type selection.
* **Real-Time Results**: Displays outputs and error messages in a terminal-style canvas.
* **Modular Design**: Built with an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for scalability.
* **Future Potential**: Plans for additional solvers (e.g., pipe sizing, heat loss) and isometric visualizations.

## Why This Project?

This app was born out of a desire to simplify duct sizing—a common task in building services engineering—while practicing core programming skills. It’s my first personal project, designed to break free from tutorial hell and tackle real-world problems I encounter at work. Think of it as a practical, no-nonsense tool with room to grow!

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/engineering-solver](https://github.com/your-username/engineering-solver)
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    * Requires Python 3.x (no external libraries needed yet—just pure Python and Tkinter!).
3.  **Launch the App**:
    ```bash
    cd engineering-solver
    python3 main.py
    ```
    * Enter duct parameters (e.g., width, height, flow rate) and hit "Calculate" to see results.

## Project Structure

* `main.py`: Application entry point and core loop.
* `ui.py`: Tkinter-based user interface with input fields and output display.
* `duct.py`: Calculation logic for duct properties (area, velocity, etc.).
* `controller.py`: Mediates between the UI and calculation logic.

## Usage Example

1.  Select "Rectangular" duct type.
2.  Input: Width = 400 mm, Height = 200 mm, Flow Rate = 300 L/s.
3.  Output: Area = 0.08 m², Velocity = 3.75 m/s.

## Roadmap

* Add input validation and warnings (e.g., high velocity alerts).
* Support for round duct diameter input.
* Visualize duct geometry with a simple isometric sketch.
* Expand to include pipe sizing and heat loss solvers.
